2. Classroom courses for all departments  
   We have a google sheet that contains a list of all classroom courses, everyone can assign by their managers or L\&D team. If anyone wants to assign their own courses on their own, follow the steps below.  
   \> First go to [courses.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19e0ui0JMKxvTyxZXjPjtMfVYSmPQVerF/edit?gid=623576320#gid=623576320)   
   \> Search for  your course as per your wish in the excel sheet, look for the enrollment code of a particular course.   
   \> Copy the code and go to [https://classroom.google.com/h](https://classroom.google.com/h)  
   \> In the top right corner, you can find the ?+? icon to join class  
   \> Click that icon, then you are asking for the class code, paste the code that you have copied. Then click join.   
   \> Now, you are able to go through the course on your own.
