# Best Practices 🌟
## Basic Git Commands
1. Initialize a New Git Repository
```sh
git init
```
2. Clone an Existing Repository
```sh
git clone <repo_url>
```
3. Check Repository Status
```sh
git status
```
4. Add Files to Staging Area
```sh
git add .
```
5. Commit Changes
```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
6. Push Changes to Remote Repository
```sh
git push origin <branch_name>
```
7. Pull Latest Changes from Remote
```sh
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
## Git Clone:
* Ensure Your SSH Key is Set Up (clearly discussed in the above > Adding public key in github account)
* Test SSH Connection to GitHub by running the following command 
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
you can see the output as follows
> shilpamudusu@penguin ~ $ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi shilpa-acog! You've successfully authenticated
{.is-success}
* Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```
For cloning the repository, we need to naviagte to the repository path, then we can find the code of the repository in three variants. They are **HTTPS**, **SSH**, **Github CLI**. You can see in the following image

* **To Clone any one of our repo into your home directory of any server, you need to copy the ssh url and clone the repository**
* Dont go for https cloning because it is deprecated for private github repos.
## Example 
* git clone using ssh url
```sh
git clone git@github.com:shilpa-acog/blog.git
```
# Request Access to acog repo 🛗
* After Completing all the above steps, you need to request access to acog repo through the google chat.
* Go to **google chats > Search for ramana@aganitha.ai > send request**
* Plese Send the request by Introducing yourself to him like 
```sh
Hi Ramana,
