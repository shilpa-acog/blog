## **Linux Mint Setup on Mac Intel**

### **Purpose**

This document serves as a communication brief and standard operating procedure to ensure a seamless and consistent setup of Linux Mint on Mac Intel machines. It is designed for internal use by the IT/Admin team and outlines a **fully managed setup process** for end users.

### **Overview**

To streamline onboarding and empower team members with a ready-to-use Linux Mint environment on Mac Intel hardware, the System Administration team will take full ownership of the installation and configuration process. Users are **not required to perform any steps themselves**. Once the setup is complete, users will receive a system that is fully configured and ready for immediate use.
