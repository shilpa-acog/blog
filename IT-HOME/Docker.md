# Docker 🐳
Docker is **an operating system for containers**. Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers.
## Docker hub info 
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry for storing, sharing, and distributing Docker images. It provides both public and private repositories, allowing developers to pull and push container images easily.
**Key Features of Docker Hub**

✅ Public & Private Repositories – Store container images securely.
✅ Official & Verified Images – Access trusted images like PostgreSQL, Redis, and Node.js.
✅ Automated Builds – Automatically build and publish images from GitHub or Bitbucket.
✅ Webhooks – Trigger actions when images are pushed or updated.
✅ Organizations & Teams – Manage access control for teams.

# How to Login Docker and commit it 🕝

```sh
